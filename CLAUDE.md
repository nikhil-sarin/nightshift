# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

NightShift is an AI-driven research automation system that uses Claude Code in headless mode to execute research tasks. It provides a staged approval workflow where a task planner agent analyzes user requests, selects appropriate MCP tools, and creates execution plans that can be reviewed before execution.

The system can be controlled via CLI or Slack, with sandboxed execution on macOS for security.

2. **Widget Rendering Tests**: Widget output verification
3. **Integration Tests**: Keybindings and UI wiring via prompt_toolkit

**Test Doubles:**
- Located in `nightshift/interfaces/tui/testing_doubles.py`
- Shared mocks: DummyQueue, DummyConfig, DummyPlanner, DummyAgent, DummyLogger
- Use `create_app_for_test()` in `app.py` to create test applications

**CI/CD:**
- GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Tests run on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- Triggered on push to main and feature/* branches, and on pull requests

# Start the Slack webhook server
nightshift slack-server

NightShift uses a concurrent task execution architecture with three main components:

### Testing
No formal test suite exists yet. Manual testing is done via:
1. CLI commands listed above
2. Slack commands in a test workspace
3. Checking logs in `~/.nightshift/logs/`

2. **Agent Manager** (nightshift/core/agent_manager.py): Executes individual tasks via `claude -p` with `--verbose --output-format stream-json`, parsing the JSON stream to extract token usage and tool calls. Spawns Claude CLI as subprocess.

3. **Task Executor** (nightshift/core/task_executor.py): Background service that polls for COMMITTED tasks and executes them concurrently using a thread pool. Supports up to N concurrent Claude CLI subprocesses (default: 3).

NightShift uses a two-agent architecture where both agents are Claude Code instances running in headless mode via the `claude` CLI:

- **TaskQueue** (nightshift/core/task_queue.py): Thread-safe SQLite-backed persistence with WAL mode enabled. Task lifecycle states: STAGED → COMMITTED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED. Supports concurrent reads/writes with `acquire_task_for_execution()` using atomic transactions.

- **TaskExecutor** (nightshift/core/task_executor.py): Manages concurrent task execution using ThreadPoolExecutor. Polls TaskQueue for COMMITTED tasks and submits them to worker threads. Each worker spawns an AgentManager subprocess.

- **ExecutorManager** (nightshift/core/task_executor.py): Singleton manager for global executor instance, ensures only one executor service runs at a time.

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyzes task description and selects appropriate MCP tools
- Determines sandbox permissions (which directories need write access)
- Generates enhanced prompt for executor
- Estimates token usage and execution time
- Sets `needs_git` flag for tasks requiring git/gh CLI access

**Key Logic:**
- Reads available tools from `nightshift/config/claude-code-tools-reference.md`
- Uses JSON schema validation to enforce structured output
- Parses response handling both direct JSON and markdown-wrapped format (task_planner.py:137-150)
- Defaults to current working directory for sandbox permissions when uncertain

### 2. Executor Agent (nightshift/core/agent_manager.py)
Executes approved tasks with restricted tool access and optional sandboxing. Invoked as:
```bash
# On macOS with sandbox enabled:
sandbox-exec -f <profile.sb> claude -p "<task>" --output-format stream-json --verbose --allowed-tools <tools> --system-prompt "<prompt>"

# On Linux or sandbox disabled:
claude -p "<task>" --output-format stream-json --verbose --allowed-tools <tools> --system-prompt "<prompt>"
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Executes task using only allowed MCP tools
- Runs inside sandbox (macOS) with restricted filesystem writes
- Parses stream-json output line-by-line
- Tracks file changes via before/after snapshots
- Reports progress and results back to task queue

**Stream-JSON Parsing:**
- Lines with `"type": "text"` → Claude's response content
- Lines with `"usage"` key → Token usage statistics
- Lines with `"type": "tool_use"` → MCP tool invocations
- Not all lines are valid JSON (some are plain text)

### Core Components

**TaskQueue** (nightshift/core/task_queue.py)
- SQLite-backed persistence with task lifecycle state machine
- Valid transitions: STAGED → COMMITTED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED
- Also supports: PAUSED, CANCELLED states
- Stores task metadata: description, allowed_tools, allowed_directories, needs_git, process_id
- Database schema includes migrations for new columns

**SandboxManager** (nightshift/core/sandbox.py)
- macOS-only sandboxing using `sandbox-exec` with `.sb` profiles
- Generates profiles that deny all writes except to allowed_directories
- Always permits: /tmp, ~/.claude/, MCP credential files
- When `needs_git=true`: also permits /dev/null, /dev/tty, ~/.config/gh/
- Profiles enforce least-privilege: read-all, execute-all, network-all, write-restricted

**FileTracker** (nightshift/core/file_tracker.py)
- Takes SHA-256 hash snapshots before/after execution
- Detects created/modified/deleted files
- Only tracks changes within working directory (not system-wide)

**Notifier** (nightshift/core/notifier.py)
- Generates completion notifications with task summary
- Supports terminal output and Slack notifications
- Saves notification JSON to `~/.nightshift/notifications/`

**SlackEventHandler** (nightshift/integrations/slack_handler.py)
- Routes Slack slash commands to NightShift operations
- Handles button interactions (Approve/Reject/Details)
- Spawns planning/execution in background threads
- Uses `SlackMetadataStore` to track Slack context per task

**SlackClient** (nightshift/integrations/slack_client.py)
- Wrapper around Slack SDK with DM detection
- Formats messages using Block Kit via `SlackFormatter`
- Handles threaded replies for async operations

**SlackServer** (nightshift/integrations/slack_server.py)
- Flask app with `/slack/commands` and `/slack/interactions` endpoints
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification via `slack_middleware.py`
- Rate limiting: 100/min global, with per-user extraction
- Caches raw request body for signature verification

### Terminal UI (TUI)

The TUI (nightshift/interfaces/tui/) uses prompt_toolkit and follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **app.py**: Application factory, creates and wires components
- **models.py**: Data structures (UIState, TaskRow, SelectedTaskState)
- **controllers.py**: Business logic layer (`TUIController` class)
- **widgets.py**: Custom prompt_toolkit controls (TaskListControl, DetailControl)
- **keybindings.py**: Keyboard shortcut definitions
- **layout.py**: UI layout composition

**TUI Keybindings:**
- `j/k` or arrows: Navigate task list
- `Enter` or `a`: Approve selected task
- `r`: Reject/cancel task
- `e`: Review/edit task plan (opens $EDITOR)
- `d`: Delete task
- `Tab`: Cycle detail tabs (overview/execution/files/summary)
- `:`: Enter command mode
- `q`: Quit
### Concurrent Execution

**Default Behavior (Async):**
- `nightshift submit --auto-approve` → Task moves to COMMITTED state → Executor picks it up asynchronously
- `nightshift approve task_id` → Task moves to COMMITTED state → Executor picks it up asynchronously
- Multiple tasks can be submitted and queued simultaneously
- Executor polls every 1s (configurable) for new COMMITTED tasks
- Up to 3 tasks (configurable) execute concurrently

**Synchronous Mode (Legacy):**
- `nightshift submit --auto-approve --sync` → Blocks until task completes
- `nightshift approve task_id --sync` → Blocks until task completes
- Useful for scripts that need to wait for results

**Configuration:**
- `NIGHTSHIFT_MAX_WORKERS`: Max concurrent tasks (default: 3)
- `NIGHTSHIFT_POLL_INTERVAL`: Polling interval in seconds (default: 1.0)
- `NIGHTSHIFT_AUTO_EXECUTOR`: Auto-start executor with Slack server (default: true)

### Data Storage

All data lives in `~/.nightshift/`:
- `database/nightshift.db` - SQLite task queue
- `logs/nightshift_YYYYMMDD.log` - Execution logs
- `output/task_XXX_output.json` - Task results and Claude output
- `output/task_XXX_files.json` - File change tracking
- `notifications/task_XXX_notification.json` - Completion summaries
- `config/slack_config.json` - Slack credentials (for Slack integration)
- `slack_metadata/task_XXX_slack.json` - Slack context (channel, user, thread)

### Claude CLI Integration

Both agents execute Claude via subprocess with specific configurations:

**Task Planner:**
```bash
claude -p "<planning_prompt>" --output-format json --json-schema <schema>
```
~/.nightshift/
├── config/
│   └── slack_config.json          # Slack credentials (encrypted/secure)
├── database/
│   └── nightshift.db              # SQLite task queue
├── logs/
│   └── nightshift_YYYYMMDD.log    # Daily execution logs
├── output/

└── slack_metadata/
    └── task_XXX_slack.json        # Slack context (channel, user, thread)
```

## Important Implementation Details

- **Thread-safety**: TaskQueue uses SQLite WAL mode and atomic transactions for concurrent access
- **Concurrent execution**: TaskExecutor uses ThreadPoolExecutor (not ProcessPoolExecutor) because AgentManager already spawns Claude CLI as separate processes
- **Task acquisition**: `acquire_task_for_execution()` uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` to atomically claim COMMITTED tasks
- No timeouts are used during development (can be added via `timeout` parameter in `execute_task`)
- Task planner response parsing handles both direct JSON and wrapper format with markdown code fences
- File tracking uses hash-based comparison (SHA-256) to detect modifications
- All Claude interactions are subprocess executions, not SDK calls
- The system does NOT use the Claude Agent SDK - it shells out to the `claude` CLI binary
- Tool selection relies on the MCP tools reference document in nightshift/config/claude-code-tools-reference.md

## Common Pitfalls

- Task planner expects structured JSON output but Claude may wrap it in markdown code fences - the parser handles this in task_planner.py
- Stream-json output must be parsed line-by-line; not all lines are valid JSON (some are plain text)
- File tracking snapshots are taken before/after execution, so files modified outside the working directory won't be detected
- Task status transitions must follow the valid state machine: STAGED → COMMITTED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED
- TUI auto-refreshes every 2 seconds - disable with `create_app_for_test(disable_auto_refresh=True)` when testing
- The `format_exec_log_from_result()` function in controllers.py parses stream-json events; understand its structure before modifying
- **Concurrent execution requires executor**: By default, `--auto-approve` and `approve` now queue tasks for async execution. You must run `nightshift executor start` or use `--sync` flag for immediate execution
- **Database locks**: If you see "database is locked" errors, check that WAL mode is enabled (`PRAGMA journal_mode` should return "wal")
- **Executor not running**: If tasks stay in COMMITTED state, the executor service may not be running. Check with `nightshift executor status`
- Task planner expects structured JSON output but Claude may wrap it in markdown code fences - the parser handles this in task_planner.py:137-150
- Stream-json output must be parsed line-by-line; not all lines are valid JSON (some are plain text)
- File tracking snapshots are taken before/after execution, so files modified outside the working directory won't be detected
- Task status transitions must follow the valid state machine: STAGED → COMMITTED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED
- **Slack server auto-starts executor**: By default, `nightshift slack-server` starts the executor service automatically. Use `--no-executor` to disable.
